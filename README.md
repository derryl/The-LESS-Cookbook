The LESS Cookbook
=================

The [LESS website](http://lesscss.org/) contains summaries of each feature the language offers. These are helpful in learning the syntax, but they provide few real-life examples. 

Namespaces? Reverse nesting? These sound cool… but how would I actually use them to improve my workflow?

Here, I attempt to answer some of these questions, by providing real-life scenarios that demonstrate the power of each feature; accompanied by best-practice suggestions for keeping your codebase clean, expressive, and future-friendly.

This "cookbook" is a work-in-progress. The language itself is continually improving, meaning some of these patterns will inevitably give way to better ones – as new features become available.
